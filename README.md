## Chomp With Friends

*Objective:*
The goal of the game is to make the other player eat the poisoned chocolate in the bottom left corner.

*Gameplay:*
* Players take turns eating 1 or more pieces of chocolate 
* Eventually, there is only the poisoned piece left to eat
* At this point the game ends

*Modes:*
* Player vs computer
* Player vs player (requires authentication because of live chat features)


## Inspiration

We were inspired by the incredible success of simple games in recent years. This power along with the desire for free chat in a game instead of being limited in what can be said made us want to try to build this.

## Building the Project

The project was built in different parts. We started with getting the framework so that we could load a page. Then we moved to making the pages be able to exist and interact with one another. The components to have the basic game, basic chat functions, and authentication started to be built separately. As this was happening, we had to plan together how everything was to merge together. As the pieces started to come together, we began having to work more with the interactivity between players. The game itself was easy enough to implement with the computer and a player, but the main goal of the game and chat were to be able to interact with a live person. By the time we had the solution to one fully solved, we just mapped it onto the other. The game came together quite easily from there and we worked together to make things cleaner where we could.

## Challenges

We faced a few challenges during the building of this project that managed to work out well. The biggest challenge was definitely figuring out which parts were the best to work on next, since a lot of things had to be in place just to start certain parts of the project. We had only 1 Git merge conflict, but that was something we had to resolve together. The documentation on Auth0 did not match the results we saw for multiple hours. This was also a large challenge to get past as we built.
